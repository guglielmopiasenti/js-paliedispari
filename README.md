4. if not, print "is not a palindrome"

# Even and odd

The user chooses even or odd and enters a number from 1 to 5.
We generate a random number (always from 1 to 5) for the computer (using a function).
Let's add the two numbers
We determine if the sum of the two numbers is even or odd (using a function)
We declare who won.

# procedure second exercise

1. asking the user to choose odd and number
2. Generate a random number between 1 and 5
3. Check if the number is even
4. determine how's the winne rwith a function:
   1. create function with a sum between the numbers chosen
   2. print the result
   3. if cycle to determine winner
   4. if cycle for invalid numbers
